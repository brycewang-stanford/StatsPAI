# JSS review period: changes to frozen manuscript artifacts

The JSS manuscript describes one tagged release (the `tag` in
`tests/jss_review_freeze.json`). Its parity, coverage, seed-study and timing
tables are re-tabulated from frozen artifacts, which that manifest hashes.
While the paper is under review, any change to one of those artifacts must be
recorded here; `tests/test_jss_review_freeze.py` fails until it is.

Rules:

1. **Do not regenerate a frozen artifact to make a table look better.** A
   change here is a correctness fix, a reference-environment change, or a
   new module, and it goes through CHANGELOG / MIGRATION as usual
   (⚠️ correctness fix if an output moves).
2. **One entry per change**, newest first, giving the date, the commit, the
   reason, and the effect on the paper: which table, listing or quoted
   number moves, and from what to what. "None" is a valid effect only if it
   was checked (for example, a module the paper does not print).
3. **List every changed path in backticks**, exactly as the test reports it.
4. The manuscript itself is not edited during review. Recorded changes are
   folded into the next revision, which is re-anchored to a new release and
   re-frozen with `python scripts/jss_review_freeze.py --write --release X.Y.Z`.
5. When the paper is decided, set `"active": false` in the manifest.

### 2026-09-27 — call traces re-recorded after the post-release merge

- **Commits.** The merge of `main` (upstream `a916c7bc`..`881fdf8c`: sdid
  refusal of staggered cohorts, LaTeX output precision, `did_had` bandwidth
  selectors, forest covariance attrs, and others) into the 1.32.0 release
  line; re-traced Track A modules 03 13 15 24 25 26 27 35 53 65 66 and
  original-data module 08.
- **Reason.** The traces bind SHA-256 digests of every source file on each
  module's estimation path; the merged commits edited some of those files,
  and upstream had recorded its traces before the release's
  `__version__`-line normalisation.
- **Effect on the paper.** None. Only `exercised_sources` digests and
  `seconds` changed; no module's implementation classification moved
  (checked field by field against `v1.32.0`), so the native / port /
  third-party census of Section 5.3 and Appendix A (86 / 0 / 3) and the
  original-data ledger's provenance marks are unchanged. No estimate,
  standard error or table cell is read from these files.
- **Paths.**
  - `tests/r_parity/results/_implementation_trace.json`
  - `tests/orig_parity/results/_implementation_trace.json`
